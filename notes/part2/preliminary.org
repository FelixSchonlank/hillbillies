* World  						      :defensive:new:

** Terrain

- Cubes can be different types of things. A cube's type can change over its
  lifetime.
  - Impassable
    - Rock
    - Wood
  - Passable
    - Air (default)
- When not (in)directly connected to the borders of the world, a cube will
  disappear (cave-in) after at most 5 seconds.
  - Algorithm for check connectedness to border is given.
- When disappearing, a cube's type changes to ``air'', and with 0.25 chance a
  Boulder (rock cube) or Log (wood cube) spawns at the center.


** Game objects

- World can contain unlimited number of Bolders and Logs
- World can contain <= 100 Units
- Factions
  - == 1 Faction per Unit
  - <= 50 Units per Faction
  - <= 5 active (non-empty) Factions per World
  - World *silently rejects* requests for excessive Units or Factions
- Implement a method to spawn Unit
  - Random initial attributes
  - Random initial position
    - In a passable cube
    - Above solid cube or on the floor of the World (Pro tip: use helper method)
      isAboveSolid.
  - Starts new Faction unless maximum Faction number reached. Then joins
    smallest Faction.
- Game objects (Units, Boulders, Logs) shall be removed upon death or
  consumption or something similar


** Game over

The game is never over! We gonna play till the break of dawn!


** Implementation

- Implement a method in World to ...
  - Inspect a given cube. Give back
    - Terrain type
    - List of objects occupying that cube
  - List all Factions
  - List all Units
    - All
    - Of a given Faction only
  - List all Boulders
  - List all Logs
  - Invoke advanceTime on all game obje


* Unit 								    :altered:

- A Unit must now always belong to 1 Faction
- Must always occupy a cube of passable terrain type
- XP
  - For every 10 XP, Units Str, Agl, *or* Tgh increases by 1.
  - For every movement step (for every block the Unit arrives at), + 1 XP.


** (Not) falling 							:new:

- Start falling when not in a cube directly adjacent to a solid cube or the
  floor of the World (use helper method aroundSolid for all this).
- When falling ...
  - Move with constant velocity (0, 0, -3)
  - Stop falling when aboveSolid
  - The Unit can't start sprinting
  - You cannot do anything
    - Not even being attacked
- Upon landing, lose 10 HP per fallen Z-level


** Basic movement 						    :altered:

- Units can only move through cubes of passable terrain type and that are
  aroundSolid cubes.
- When arriving at a block by delibirately moving there, a Unit gains 1 XP.


** Extended movement and path finding 				    :altered:

- A new path finding algorithm is given.
- Note that due to the changing of the World, the path must be from recalculated
  every block a Unit arrives at. There is no longer a point in storing a path,
  only in storing an ultimateTarget.
- Moving to faraway blocks can be interrupted, *but must be resumed!*
- When ultimateTarget is unreachable, moving is terminated.


** Work 							    :altered:

- Redefine method ``work'' to order the Unit to work at given block
  - Must be current or adjacent block
  - Store the target block somewhere
- Upon completion of the work, there will be checked what kind of work has been
  done.
  - Carrying Boulder or Log :: The Boulder or Log is dropped at the center of
       the *target working cube*.
  - Target cube is Workshop and one Boulder and Log are available there :: 
       One Boulder and Log will be consumed from target cube. Weight and
       Toughness increased by 1.
  - Boulder or Log present on target cube :: The Unit picks it up.
  - Target cube is of Wood type :: The cube disappears, leaving a Log.
  - Target cube is of Rock type :: The cube disappears, leaving a Boulder.
  - No condition is met :: Nothing happens.
- Weight of Unit is own weight plus weight of Boulder or Log the Unit is
  carrying.
  - Temporary weight may exceed maximum weight
- + 10 XP for every fully completed work


** Fighting 							    :altered:

- You can now only attack Units of a different Faction.
- + 20 XP for succesful attack, dodge, or block.
- Dodging teleportation can now only be to blocks featuring passable terrain.


** Death 								:new:

- Units die at 0 HP.
- Dead Units can't conduct activities.
- Picked up stuff will be dropped at Unit's position.


** Default behavior 						    :altered:

- One possibility when idle is now to fight potential enemies.


* Boulder and Log 					      :defensive:new:

- Position
  - Use doubles
  - Always in passable terrain
  - When not aboveSolid, starts falling like a Unit.
    - Implement advanceTime
- Weight
  - Use int
  - âˆˆ [10 ; 50]
  - Chosen at random upon creation
  - Doesn't change
- Not present in World when being carried
- Re-enters World when dropped
