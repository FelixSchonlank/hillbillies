* Reorganize part1

Not even looking at the part 2 pdf yet, just the changes that should be made to
get our project in a more workable state.

** Path finding

No longer store an immediateTarget and a path, but and immediateTarget and an
ultimateTarget. Every time a Unit arrives at a cube, recalculate immediateTarget
based on ultimateTarget.

** @Value classes

*** Position

To hold <x, y, z> doubles.

*** Coordinate

To hold <x, y, z> as integer values.

** Relocate methods

- To World
  - minCoordinate
  - maxCoordinate
  - cubeCoordinates
  - areAdjacentCubes
  - cubeCenter
  - withinBounds
  - areSameCube
  - getRandomCoordinate
- To VectorUtils
  - between
  - normalize
- To IAdvanceable
  - getMaxDT
  - advanceTime
